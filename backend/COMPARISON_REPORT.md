## Analysis

### Agreement Rate
- Experience Level Agreement: 0.0%
- Language Detection Agreement: 100.0%

### Performance
- Average Processing Time (Embedding): 0.463s
- Average Processing Time (Phi): 1.259s
- Phi is 0.4x slower than the embedding approach

### Key Observations
1. Experience Level Detection:
   - Low agreement between approaches
   - Phi tends to be less efficient

2. Language Detection:
   - High agreement between approaches
   - Both methods successfully identify primary programming languages
