I am a computer science student with strong skills in Python and web development. 
I have experience with Django, Flask, and FastAPI frameworks. 
I'm interested in contributing to open-source projects related to data science, machine learning, and API development.
I'm comfortable with REST APIs, database design, and have basic knowledge of React for frontend work.
I'm looking for beginner-friendly issues to get started with open-source contributions.
